                <a name="Kevin Durant"></a>
                <h2>Kevin Durant</h2>
                <p>
                    With <b>2x NBA championships</b> both awarded the MVP, 4x scoring titles as the leagues leading scorer, 2x Olympic gold medals, 9x All-NBA teams, and 11 All-Star appearances, there is no denying the greatness of Kevin Durant. If not for some major injuries many critics believe he would have 4x Championships. The ability for "KD" to be an assest in any scheme or type of teams speaks to his immense basketball skill. There is not one GM in the NBA that wouldn't pay any price to have Durant on their team.

                <a name="Lebron James"></a>
                <h2>LeBron James</h2>
                <p>
                    Though coming off an NBA Championship in the 'bubble', LeBron James is much more effective as a coach on the court than the load-bearing wheel of a championship team. When fully engaged there is little argument about who the most dominant player in the NBA is. <b>4x NBA Champion, MVP and League MVP</b> a 16x All-NBA, 17x All-Star, 2x All-Star MVP and 1x Scoring Champion are only some of the achievements of James' career. However, at 37 years of age LeBron isn't able to operate at heightened intensities for a full playoff run. Capable of being a great scorer, facilitator and rebounder, James can fill the statsheet. The problem lies with what doesn't appear, things such as man to man and help defense have become major weakpoints in LeBron's game.

                <h2>Stephen Curry</h2>
                <p>
                    The unquestionable greatest shooter in the history of the sport, Stephen Curry has cemented his place in basketball history. Winner of <b>3x NBA Championships</b>, 2x League MVP's (first ever unanimous), 2x scoring title, 6x All-NBA, and 7x NBA All-Star, there is little question that Curry conquered the 2010's. Interestingly, there were doubts on whether Curry was a beneficiary of the Warriors system or the torch that provided the spark. His ability to get hot at any time in the game, from anywhere on the court, allowed him to propel a talent deficient and injury plagued team to 1 game from the playoffs. Leading the NBA in scoring while being the sole focus of defenses across the league, Steph demonstrated his pure basketball ability.

                <a name="Kawhi Leonard"></a>
                <h2>Kawhi Leonard</h2>
                <p>
                    Another winner of <b>2x NBA championships</b> both awarded the MVP, 2x Defensive Player of the Year, 5x All-NBA and All-Star. Kawhi Leonard is arguably the best 'two-way' player in the NBA. His ability to be the teams leading scorer while also defending the opposing teams best offensive weapon speaks to his all world basketball ability. While plagued with injuries since 2017, when healthy Kawhi is a player every coach would love to have.

                <h2>5a. James Harden</h2>
                <p>
                    The only member of this top 5 list to not yet win a championship, James Harden's legacy is still soldified by his penchant for consistently leading the best offenses in the NBA.  A league MVP, 3x scoring titles, 7x All-NBA teams, 9x All-Star, and a Assists Leader title provides the critial acclaim for his incomprehensible offensive abilities.

                <a name="Giannis Antetokounmpo"></a>
                <h2>5b. Giannis Antetokounmpo</h2>
                <p>
                    The "Greek Freak", Giannis Antetokounmpo is coming off of back to back NBA MVp seasons and a Defensive Player of the Year award. Currently his team sits 2 wins away from winning their first championship in 50 years and Giannis is a sure bet to take home Finals MVP honors. A perenial statsheet-stuffer, there is little question who is the most dominant force in the NBA, often resembling a freight train in transition. However, his playoff runs of late have seen the train come to a screeching halt once teams employ the 'wall' strategy.
